# Serial monitor

Yet another serial port terminal written as a replacement for Arduino serial monitor. 
It features a history of sent commands so they can be easily resent on doubleclik without 
need to retype them. It can send text as a line (press enter or click "send") or as a stream of characters 
as you type them.

**Currently tested on windows only. On Linux machines it might be needed to start this app with SUDO, 
due to permissions required for accessing serial ports.**

[Java JRE](https://java.com/en/download/) (version 8 or greater) is required to launch this application.
